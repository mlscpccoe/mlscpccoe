# MLSC PCCOE

## Who we are?
Microsoft Learn Student Chapter is a passionate student-led community focused on fostering a strong and inclusive tech culture at PCCOE. We aim to empower students by providing a platform to explore modern technologies, sharpen their coding skills, and collaborate with peers.
We organize a wide range of technical eventsâ€”ranging from hands-on workshops, coding competitions, and hackathons to tech talks and collaborative projects. These initiatives are designed to not only enhance students' technical know-how but also to encourage innovation, teamwork, and leadership.
